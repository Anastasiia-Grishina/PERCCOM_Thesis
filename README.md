# PERCCOM Thesis

Investigation on energy consumption and thermal characteristics of two clusters CRESCO4 and CRESCO6 
of a Data Center residing in ENEA Portici Research Center.

- Energy efficiency and thermal metrics are used to evaluate clusters' performance, new metrics are proposed
- DC impact on the environment is shown through indirect carbon emissions evaluation per month
- All results are visualized for further use in the manuscript
